This is MVP of the oregon trail. the game has many of the features implimented, and operates in a smooth and efficient manner. The site utilized Vue, MongoDB, and a custom API written by
Thomas to allow the majority of the game to run as a finite state machine. this allowed the team to add features with easy and deploy game logic quickly.
